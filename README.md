---

## 🧭 What is a Web Server?

A **web server** is a software or hardware system that delivers web content (such as HTML pages, images, and APIs) to clients (browsers or applications) over the internet or intranet.

### 🔧 Common Uses of Web Servers
- Hosting websites
- Serving REST APIs for applications
- Load balancing
- SSL/TLS security management
- Content caching

### 🖥️ Popular Web Servers

| Web Server | Description | Platform |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Apache HTTP Server** | Open-source, flexible, widely used | Cross-platform |
| **Nginx** | Lightweight, high performance, ideal for static content & reverse proxy | Cross-platform |
| **Microsoft IIS** | Windows-based, integrates with .NET stack | Windows only |

---

## 🧑‍💻 Client-Server Architecture

In this model:
- **Client**: Requests resources or services (e.g., browsers, mobile apps).
- **Server**: Provides resources (e.g., web pages, database data).

Client-server enables **separation of concerns**, scalability, and distributed computing.

---

## 🏗️ N-Tier Architecture

N-Tier (multi-tier) architecture divides the system into multiple layers or tiers.

### Common Layers:
1. **Presentation Layer** – UI (React, Angular, etc.)
2. **Application/Business Logic Layer** – Processes commands, logic (Node.js, .NET, Java)
3. **Data Layer** – Handles data operations (SQL, MongoDB, etc.)

Benefits:
- Better maintainability
- Scalability
- Separation of concerns

---

## 🔀 MVC vs MVVM Architecture

### 🔸 MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- **Model**: Manages data and business logic
- **View**: UI presentation layer
- **Controller**: Handles input and updates model/view

Used in: ASP.NET MVC, Ruby on Rails

### 🔹 MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Model**: Data and logic
- **View**: UI
- **ViewModel**: Binds model to view and handles presentation logic

Used in: WPF, Angular, Vue.js

---

## 🔗 JSON and API Communication (B2B)

### What is JSON?
**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight data-interchange format used in APIs.

### Why Use JSON in B2B API Calls?
- Easy to parse and human-readable
- Platform and language-independent
- Ideal for modern RESTful APIs

### Example:
```json
{
  "orderId": 101,
  "status": "confirmed",
  "items": [
    { "product": "Keyboard", "qty": 2 },
    { "product": "Mouse", "qty": 1 }
  ]
}
```
